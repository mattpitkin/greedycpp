Some items to do

1) current masses are in units of solar mass. For maximum flexibility, the ts class should carry around this information as well a how to multiply m1,m2 for input into the model generation routine. the greedy.cpp code itself should not need to use or know about these complexities

2) code should be able handle the higher dimensional cases. preferably arbitrary dimensions, and ts should again handle this. 

3) interfacing with rompy to call waveform models and leverage other features

4) computing waveforms on the fly instead upfront 

5) amplitude and phase should be treated like any other model and, in that way, passed to model_wv as a flag

6) code should be as appliciation independnet as possible. removing GW jargon everywhere

7) code should be checkpointable

8) output files should go to common folder along with config file used for the simulation. 

8a) binary or hdf5 output? ignore basis.txt output?

Some items to do

1) computing waveforms on the fly instead upfront 

2) code should be checkpointable

3) support hdf5 

4) role weights into ts components and use Euclidean inner product. Will be faster

5) params_, mystart, myend, matrix_sub_size contain global proc information while
they only need local information. Better memory usage 

6) for very large GQ points, the p_roots call in generate_quadrature is slow.
   Use a faster algorithm

7)  num = 1 (for higher d>1 models)
 
8) Bug: valgrind reports memory leak when WriteGreedyInfo writes R matrix

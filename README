Usage
-----
 -- serial mode --
1) edit greedy.cpp (see below)
2) run 'make Greedy'
3) run './greedy'

  -- mpi --
1) run 'make'
2) mpirun -np NUM_PROCS ./greedympi

Running without mpi
-------------------

comment out the following code 
1) include of mpi.h
2) GreedyWorker and GreedyMaster routines
3) MPI::Init and few lines which follow
4) MPI::Finalize()
5) GreedyWorker and GreedyMaster function calls within main() 



To Do
-----
0) R matrix (from QR) has 0 for R(0,0), whereas it should be 1
1) make code more generic to handle snapshot S not from GW appliction (greedy class?)
2) for larger problems we will need iterative modified GS instead of modified
3) for very large problem we will need to recompute the solutions, or read from disk
4) read in m1 and m2 from file
5) parameter file

possible optimization
---------------------
1) multiply all vectors by square root of weights so Euclidean inner product can be used.

WARNING: while making changes to code, make sure one can reproduce the regression test!!!

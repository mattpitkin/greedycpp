Some items to do

1) code should be able handle the higher dimensional cases. preferably arbitrary dimensions, and ts should again handle this. 

2) interfacing with rompy to call waveform models and leverage other features

3) computing waveforms on the fly instead upfront 

4) code should be as appliciation independnet as possible. removing GW jargon everywhere

5) code should be checkpointable

6) binary or hdf5 output? ignore basis.txt output?

7) role weights into ts components and use Euclidean inner product. Will be faster

8) finish checking ND TS from file routine

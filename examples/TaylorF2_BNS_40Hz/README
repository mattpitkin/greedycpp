Reproduces 40hz basis (with GQ rule used in first dimensional reduction stage) 
as described in "Accelerated gravitational-wave parameter estimation with 
reduced order modeling"

logarithmic parameter sampling of 500 per mass dimension 

quadrature points generated using generate_quadrature.py, which agree with 
other codes up to 1e-12

Output (greedy points, approximation errors) agree with independent python
code to machine epsilon.

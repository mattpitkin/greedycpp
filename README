Usage
-----
1) edit settings in greedy.cpp
2) run 'make'
3) run './greedy'

To Do
-----
1) handle case where number of RB exceeds the estimted number
2) make code more generic to handle snapshot S not from GW appliction (greedy class?)
3) add mpi
4) for larger problems we will need iterative modified GS instead of modified
5) for very large problem we will need to recompute the solutions, or read from disk

possible optimizations
----------------------
1) multiply all vectors by square root of weights so Euclidean inner product can be used.

WARNING: while making changes to code, make sure one can reproduce the regression test!!!

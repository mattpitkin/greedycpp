--- building the roq (linear and quadratic) on a single interval ---

Write me!



--- validations of greedy and eim data ---

1) Modify the SetupMultipleValidations.py script to validate an ROQ (data in the folder)

2) run ./mergeValidations, delete old folders
3) merge all validation files into a single one

>>> cat test.txt* > validations.txt [or skip this step, if the file sizes are too large]
>>> cat bad_points_test.txt* > ts_bad_points.txt
>>> rm bad_points_test.txt*

4) can check the worst validations in ipython

>>> x = np.loadtxt('validations.txt')  [x = np.loadtxt('test.txt0')]
>>> x.max(axis=0)

5) if there are bad points, enrich the basis (see bitbucket wiki).


--- resampling for a \delta f = constant (1/128, e.g.) ---

1) setup a directory for the new run

>>> mkdir df128

2) link to setup_new_quad.py, change settings and run in the folder

3) submit the job with roq.build.sh

# Overview

A fast, scalable and easy-to-use parallelization of the greedy algorithm for building application-specific basis, empirical interpolants and reduced order quadrature rules. 

In many cases, for example when implemented on a computer and using the Euclidean inner product, the greedy algorithm is QR with column pivoting. And so this code may also be used to compute QR decompositions of a large, dense matrix.

For details on the code's scaling and QR-based model reduction:

Some items to do

1) computing waveforms on the fly instead upfront 

2) code should be checkpointable

3) binary or hdf5 output? ignore basis.txt output?

4) role weights into ts components and use Euclidean inner product. Will be faster

5) params_, mystart, myend, matrix_sub_size contain global proc information while
they only need local information. Better memory usage 

6) for very large GQ points, the p_roots call in generate_quadrature is slow.
   convert to algorithm used in matlab code.

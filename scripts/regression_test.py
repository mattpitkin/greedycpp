"""
Module to do regression test of output directory against a version
that has been archived.  

Can run at command line from an application directory, e.g.:
  $ python regression_test.py OUTDIR1 OUTDIR2
to compare the data in OUTDIR1 to the regression data in OUTDIR2.

To add new data to repository use the save_regression_data.py module.

Notes: 
  This uses the difflib module to produce diffs if files do not agree and
  display them as webpages.  If there are many diffs, this won't necessarily
  do a line-by-line comparison, which might be preferable.
